    "## 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every chilly November morning I had my first class of the day in a brick wall class room. This was my honors 10th grade english class--most people in this class were at least fairly literate. Even so, half of the class would be nodding off or spacing out when the teacher asks about whether or not the gerund up on the projector was grammatical in the sentence, or why Gatsby was obsessed with the color green, or how you should use MLA citations.\n",
    "However one day, we got the teacher off track enough that we were 30 minutes into class and she didn't feel like teaching anymore (she must have been tenured, that lady was not fully mentally anyways) so she decided to go around the room and ask everyone where they saw themselves in five years. Mostly I got to hear my best friend talk about how she'll be in law school, and my friend from middle school discuss how he is already starting to work in his dad's plumbing business. I'm not paying attention much; it is 8am after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I definitely tune back in when I hear the quiet kid say:\n",
    "\"Probably in the back of some van.\"\n",
    "That was a very brash response, but some people do want to live out of vans and travel the country. So as any decent person would, the teacher says he probably wants to do it to travel or play music and be in a band, right?\n",
    "He responds\n",
    "\"No, hopefully not breathing.\"\n",
    "Uhh.... Obviously I look at my friend next to me and everyone else in the class is making eyes at each other as well. This teacher, not having much mental hold of herself on a normal day already, says with an uncomfortable chuckle \"that's morbid\" and then we move onto the next person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it's been about five years and that kid is still breathing and not in the back of some van. He came into the restaurant I was a server at once with his family and they all seemed very nice. However, unlike many of the other kids in that class, he did not attempt to pursue any higher education and I believe he is now practicing Buddism daily.\n",
    "Sometimes I wonder if had he had a better experience in life overall that year if maybe he would have at least gone to community college, or applied to some small schools the next fall that would have given him a scholarhsip. There is nothing wrong with practicing Buddism, though he was intelligent and could have definitely been closer to a stable career path by now if he had a plan for his future in high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We all either have been or will be 10th graders at one point in life. Maybe that was the year you finally joined cross country, the year you and your best friend became no longer friends, or the year you asked your crush to the dance and they said yes.\n",
    "Sophomore year of high school for many hosts the creation of memories to last a lifetime. Though as you are growing socially and in real-life experience, you are also at a cornerstone for making decisions about colleges, majors, and careers. The memories garnered during 10th grade will be the evidence to shape a sense of self and percieved place in life which determine your decisions about where you see yourself in 5 and 20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "There are many proposed factors influencing what careers paths people will end up with. For example, the aptitudes, attitudes, and expectations of peers and parents, how well a student did in previous classes, how much recognition a student gets for good work, or their socioeconomic background.\n",
    "The University of Michigan has conducted a <a href=\"https://www.lsay.org/about.html\">logitudinal study</a> following students and their parents from 7th to 12th grade, where each year they answer a set of questions related to school and other questions about their lives and opinions.\n",
    "They provide the full dataset from these surveys, including questions about the amount of homework they do for a class, their opinions on specific subjects, teacher gender, and summer activities.\n",

    "This dataset contains 11,904 columns, a few corresponding to either demographics and identifiers, and most containing the response from each survey question. Each row is the answer for a student (case), and that row includes all questions answered throughout the study and are not grouped by years (2014-2017). A difference in year is denoted by the letters in the column code. A full description of the data is available in the dataset's <a href=\"../files/30263-0001-Codebook-ICPSR.pdf\">codebook</a>.\n",

Pandas also has methods for reading in <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_spss.html\">SPSS</a> and <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html\">CSV</a> files."
